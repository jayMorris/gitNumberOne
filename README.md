# gitNumberOne
My first repository on GitHub

I am a technically savvy Web Designer and Developer based out of Los Angeles, California. I am consistently pushing my creative and technical boundaries. I have a passion for Branding, Typography, Interactive design and UI design. I also have strong skills in music and Audio Engineering. When I'm not coding I am either spending time with my family or playing music with my band Animato.
